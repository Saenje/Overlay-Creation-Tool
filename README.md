# Jetrospect's Overlay Creation Tool

A project being developed to simplify the creation of custom widgets and aid content creators, limiting their expenses to achieve an aesthetic, responsive stream overlay.

## Description

This application contain and aesthetic UI and will ease the process of creating a smooth tie between StreamElements event lists, labels, logo animations and supporter alerts. It will be used to generate blocks of code that will be transferrable to the StreamElements custom code dialog tabs with minimal edits for it to successfully operate as a browser source.

## Roadmap

I hope that tool proves useful to anyone that stumbles upon it. Any recommendations to improve optimization and/or ease of use are welcome in the discussions. Please be advised that every bit of this programming I have researched, self-taught myself and it may require many edits before reaching its full potential. As the project progresses, I will populate this with section with ideas to be added in the future.

## Help

As the project develops, this section will be populated with commonly encountered problems and known ways to solve them.
